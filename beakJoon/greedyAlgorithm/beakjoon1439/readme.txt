How to get answer of this problem

First I thought about odd & even length of string
So, I wrote down on my note and found some rules on this string

1.	1001001 can translate as 10101
	and also 1001111001011111 as 1010101

2.	I suddenly focused how many the string changed
	1010's answer is 2 & 10101's answer is 2 too LMAO

3. 	if they have two changes I need to swap one more
	and it starts 1 changes ex) 1 -> 0, 10 -> 1, 101-> 1, 1010 -> 2, ...

4.	following this rule, (changes+1)/2 is the answer
