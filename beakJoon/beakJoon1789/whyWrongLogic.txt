	because{
		this can't calculate when S - sum == 0{
			example{
				if S = 55;
				when n == 10{
					sum == 55 so S - sum == 0;
				}
				it seems there is no wrong but when n == 9{
					sum == 45 so S - sum == 10;
					and ++n comes first and then S - sum < n;
					then S - sum == 10, n == 10 so "for loop" is endded;
					and it prints n-1 {
						so it prints 9 not 10;
						now there is a problem!;
					}
